Possible Theory of Everything
----------------------------

Space-time is infinite, and to define something which cannot be measured by any
normal metric of the means can only be solved with imagination and a certain
degree of truth.

Baryon asymmetry is one of physical cosmologists biggest unsolved mysteries.

It asserts a disproportionate ratio between the amount of matter and antimatter in our observable Universe
in regards with the Big Bang.

Due to the destructive nature of physical interactions between matter and antimatter, one
would naturally wonder where does the reason lie for this known uncertainty?

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy increases with time in an isolated closed-system.
A physicist would probably then allude to the likely foreshadowing of Universal heat death.

As such, we would then think to ourselves why would the Universe completely dissipate matter
into intangible energy over time? I would gesture, this excess lack of work might indicate an equivalence principle
which could do work on antimatter, and vice versa.

In what ways do matter -> radiation decay -> zero work, indicate what we already know about
the Law of Conservation of Energy/Mass/Momentum and the known relationship between matter, antimatter,
energy, and space-time?




I purpose a newer and more novel way of looking at space-time as a whole. As well as, its relationship
to many cosmological and subatomic incongruencies.

Entropy moves in the same direction as an arrow-of-time. The longer things naturally occur over time in a
closed isolated system, the more it seemingly becomes both chaotic and unpredictable, relative to its originally
measured state.

However, with the STRONG consideration of CPT-symmetry - one might be inclined to postulate two arrows-of-time
occurring independently in the same space-time field. Relative to our daily, highly localized
existence on Earth - all matter we observe appears to be moving "forward" in time. There's also an equivalent
probability that we are the antimatter counterpart... Moving "backwards" in time - so to speak. The distinction
between knowing whether we are matter or antimatter is no more philosophically important than labeling protons
with positive charge, or electrons with positive charge. It's a reference point to observe from.

The larger idea is that the baryon asymmetry problem exists solely due to a simple misunderstanding of the Big Bang(s).

The assumption states that there was an equal amount of matter and antimatter at the very moment when
the Big Bang happened.

This assumption is most likely false. Antimatter and matter are well-documented to explode into pure energy just in mere
contact with each other.

Einstein's Mass-energy equivalence principle and theory of General Relativity should apply to both matter, and antimatter.
If that assertion holds true, then any matter that decays into energy (over an uncertain period of time) can theoretically
be transformed into antimatter, if and only if those anti-particles undergo matter->energy->antimatter in a maximum entropic energy state.

Wherein, any formations, combinations, permutations, and or possibilities of what the future could be, have already been fully idealized
in this theoretical entropic environment.

However, I should state that by the very foundation of the laws of physics, universal energy had to come from somewhere.
Understanding where it came from, where we're going, and why, is ultimately non-essential to understanding the cosmic web
as best as realistically possible in any measurable terms.

Maximum entropy is best described thermodynamically when the conditions of thermal equilibrium are met between two different
systems.

The matter which comprises our observable Universe will be converted into energy over an extremely, long period of time.
That energy could then be recycled - in what I assume to be some unknown, natural cosmological process - into antimatter.

Vice versa, if antimatter enters heat death - its energy may be converted naturally back into matter to form another Big Bang.




The reason we don't observe any antimatter in the observable universe is due to the mind-blowing fact, which is, antimatter
has already been used to convert into energy and back into the matter which embodies the present moment!

The relative direction of matter's "arrow-of-time" is directly opposite to antimatters "arrow-of-time".

                     |
                     antimatter heat death has already occurred (in our time period) if we consider any possible timeline,
                     in the near to long-term to unimaginably-long-term,
                     future (which has yet to be determined truthfully as far as we can tell), has already been accounted for in a max entropy scope.
                     Therefore being able to accurately predict our future is indeterminate without perfect CPT-symmetry.

                     also, it is indeterminate whether or not we can truly know
                     if an "antimatter mirrored-reality" would be as perfectly symmetric as we might believe it to be...

Hopefully this picture doesn't imply the belief of fate or destiny in this idea. Albeit, the idea for perfectly symmetric mirror-realities
existing in the same space-time field is theoretically possible (impossible considering the infinite array of possibilities
to occur - as well as max entropy - otherwise any reality could repeat on itself for an infinite period of time) if and only if we consider
using two simultaneous, finite, universal state functions; to even indicate it may be a distinct possibility.

Even then, those purely symmetric realities could hypothetically have some sort of destructive interference - ending all reality as we even know
it to be.


IMPORTANT NOTE: What if we approach this circle, as if there was an imaginary radius that approaches an infinitesimally small point?
                
                Wherein, two discontinuous, infinitely small points (which represent maximum entropy events) can be folded on top of themselves,
                in a geometrically, origami-style fashion (if we wish to imagine it this particular way).
                
                The "Circle of Time" could then easily be folded in half (fold axis is assumed to be down the middle,
                relative initial conditions for how it's orientated are irrelevant in this scenario), fold on itself again, except perpendicularly,
                where two discontinuous event singularities (or anomalies) have essentially become a single point in space-time;
                rinse-repeat until folding reaches one dimensionality in the context of this "Circle of Time" figure.
                
                In theory, this fictional, or non-fictional, "Circle of Time" represents a closed, one-dimensional loop.
                Therefore, we could approximate truly, a one dimesional structure that can be represented or abstracted
                in any mathematical n-th dimensional structure.
                
                In the most simple terms, we can describe the entropy states of these two events, or possibly an infinite variety of events,
                using the Universal state function, while considering them in the same context -> space-time.

                        A = 4.8039016e+32 (m^2 kg / s)
                        
                        1
                      ----- = 2.0816413e-33 ( s / m^2 kg)
                        A
                
                                        1         
                        where x_0 =  -------  =  A  , and x_1 = x_0;
                                       π*h        
                                       
                        U_matter(x_0)(-) = -1;
                        U_anti  (x_1)(+) =  1;
                        
                                 or
                                 
                        U_anti  (x_0)(-) = -1;
                        U_matter(x_1)(+) =  1;
                        
                     Thus, U_matter + U_anti = 0. Entropy could be conserved.


Think of it like this, Bob hops on the train at 6:00 AM for work. He hops off the train at 7:00 AM. He gets to the office at around 7:30 AM.
That's a simple difference of 1.5 hours into the future.

Now, Anti-Bob leaves to the office at around 7:30 AM. Gets onto the train at 7:00 AM and rides the train home until 6:00 AM.
That's a simple difference of 1.5 hours into the past - wherein all actions can be reversed in a purely symmetric fashion -
relative to our current timeline.

Alas, here's the mind-blowing part. How do we know which one is Bob, and which one is Anti-Bob? Surely, Bob is the one
traveling into the future and Anti-Bob is going backwards in time! Wrong! We only perceive that Anti-Bob is going backwards
in time due to our current relative arrow-of-time. But it is of utmost importance to highlight the fact that from Anti-Bob's perspective,
he was going into the future while Bob was the one who was going into the past! Thus an equivalent relationship between Bob and Anti-Bob
can be established on the grounds of General Relativity. Yet I should also note, antimatter and matter may be unable to exist
in a stable environment together. Which is primarily why I've determined this discontinuous circle, centered around using PI as a
general constant; can possibly be used universally. At the most rudimentary level, circles incorporate infinity...

The point at which antimatter heat death occurs and the Big Bang ('matter'), is our current rudimentary plane of
existence. Which is very likely just one in a long run of an infinite variety of universes and anti-universes [popping in and out
of space-time] while relying on some unorthodox principles I have yet to state mathematically.

The point at which matter heat death occurs and 'antimatter' Big Bang begins, COULD quite literally
play the exact sequence of events which had historically precedented in our own timeline - in a reverse fashion - in the same
space-time continuum. Or even more spooky, completely different.

Here's another way of looking at it. As a thermodynamic system progresses forward in time, it increases in entropy (assume closed-system).
But if we can document and record true data over time, the past has zero entropy since it has already taken affect into the truthfully present moment.
In short, by the time we reach the end of the solar system - when the Sun explodes billions of years from now... And plus a significant order of
magnitude of time later; we'll have reached maximum entropy in heat death [matter], and the past remains a quantifiable truth which
has already vindicated the passing present. In theory, if the present reaches a point in time in the future where
space-time momentarily "pops out of existence" again, everything true about the past has been knowingly objectified
either due to the culmination of natural forces, and or human will.

Energy, entropy, mass, and momentum could then theoretically be conserved.

 Universal state function

T_0 = -inf
T_1 =  inf

h = 6.62607015×10^(−34) J/Hz                 # Planck's constant

Let U(x) be a Universal state function,
    where U(x) is an element of real numbers,
    and T_0 < x < T_1 is a FINITE subset of real numbers in a temporal dimension (seconds).

    NOTE: IF T_0 <= x <= T_1 THEN x is an infinite set of real numbers,
          WHEREIN the only significant answer would be in INDETERMINATE form...

The purpose of this universal state function is to be able to determine a direct relationship to every known constant or known mathematical equivalency among other theories.

Subject to modifications.

Note: There's also the possibility that if matter and antimatter timelines overlap with perfect symmetry, it would be another possible way for the Universe
to collapse in on itself (i.e. Big Crunch)
