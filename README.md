# philosophical-physics-baryon-asymmetry

Here's my solution to Baryon asymmetry and possibly the Theory of Everything. Not perfect and definitely needs refinement but I think most of the right ideas are there.

It really bothers me that I can't publish this online without any way of it getting ripped off in terms of originality - so I've decided to satisfy my scientific soul
by releasing it into the wild for free. So, here it is for all - to view, download, copy, or modify - for free. Under the condition that it is technically,
software.

Also, trying to get this thing published, or claiming intellectual property, seems like a pain in the ass (energy, $$$, time) so all the more reason to let it go from here.

Oh! Also, here's my differential calculus for Matter to Anti-Matter equivalence (unproven but lgtm ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

     (dt / dm)  =  -(dt / dm_anti)

or

     (dm / dt)  =  -(dm_anti / dt)
      

Have fun,

P.S. Modern publishing avenues need some serious work. Otherwise, I'd never consider to enter academic publishing, simply on the account of researchers getting bent over backwards for a buck. All my scientific heros would be disgusted, as am I. There's no pricetag on quality work, otherwise you could've bought it already...
