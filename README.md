# philosophical-physics-baryon-asymmetry

Here's my solution to Baryon asymmetry and possibly the Theory of Everything. Not perfect and definitely needs refinement but I think most of the right ideas are there.

It really bothers me that I can't publish this online without any way of it getting ripped off in terms of originality - so I've decided to satisfy my scientific soul
by releasing it into the wild for free. So, here it is for all - to view, download, copy, or modify - for free. Under the condition that it is technically,
software.

Have fun,
